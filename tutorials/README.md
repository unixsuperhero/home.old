This directory contains tutorials that I should write.

It should contain useful shell features.


## To Write

* Using `!!` and other variations of `!` to access the command-line's history
  * For example, `!-4:s/install/global/p` (probably doesn't work btw) but there
    is a way to replace install with global 4 cmds up in the history, and
    instead of running the results, just print the command that _would_ run.
